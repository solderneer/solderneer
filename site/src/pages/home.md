Hello, my name isÂ [Shan](https://solderneer.me/), and welcome to my cozy corner of the internet!

Currently, I spend most of my time thinking about how to use networks to provide civilizational services, led by my project to build a preventive healthcare network at [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care). 

I'm curious about how socio-technologies like [decentralized autonomous organizations](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/), [retroactive public goods funding](https://protocol.ai/blog/hypercert-new-primitive/), and [network states](https://thenetworkstate.com/on-network-states) might open potential solutions to wicked problems like healthcare. And what tools we might build to catch our social systems up with our technological growth.

Tangentially, I'm studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [UCL](https://ucl.ac.uk) where I'm exploring my interests in neurotech, specifically around using neurotech as a tool to preserve human agency in the age of AI.

As a quick primer, on this blog you will find [[top-of-mind|notes]] and [letters](https://solderneer.me/letters/). Notes are shorter, scrap-work style wikis, held together by an associative link graph. Letters are more thoughtful and longer-form work which are standalone pieces of writing.
