## 👋  Hello there!

My name is [Shan / Sudharshan / சுதர்சன்](https://solderneer.me/). Currently, I'm working on silent speech interfaces and human-computer interaction at [Clay Interface](https://clayinterface.com).

Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering at [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk), and have worked on a variety of projects ranging from [decentralized preventive healthcare](https://heacare.substack.com/p/networks-work-in-healthcare-and-beyond), [modular bioreactors](https://www.dynacyte.com/) and [swarm robotics platforms](https://github.com/makerforceio/Sentibots).

### A primer on this site
This site consists of [[top-of-mind|notes]] and [letters](/letters). Notes are shorter, scrap-work style wikis, held together by an associative link graph. Letters are more thoughtful and longer-form work which are standalone pieces of writing.
