Hello, my name is [Shan](https://solderneer.me/), and welcome to my cozy corner of the internet!

Currently I'm interested in 🧠 human-computer interfaces, 🏫 decentralized systems, 🔌 electronics engineering, 💭 morality.

Right now, I'm working on [decentralized healthcare at Happily Ever After](https://hea.care/), and getting a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at [UCL](https://ucl.ac.uk). You can find out more about me on my [About](https://solderneer.me/posts/about/) page :)

As a quick primer, on this blog you will find [[top-of-mind|notes]] and [letters](https://solderneer.me/letters/). Notes are shorter, scrap-work style wikis, held together by an associative link graph. Letters are more thoughtful and longer-form work which are standalone pieces of writing.
