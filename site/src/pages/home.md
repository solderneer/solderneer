## 👋  Hello there!

My name is [Shan / Sudharshan / சுதர்சன்](https://solderneer.me/). You might also know me online as **@solderneer** on most platforms.

Currently, I'm working on **enabling human superintelligence**, with neurotech, at [Epiph](https://epiph.tech).
I'm also a final year student at [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk), studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering.


### tldr: 🤖 🧠 🦾 ☮️
I want to contribute to frontier technologies which bring humans and machines into harmony. Currently, non-invasive neurotech has my fancy, but I'm also curious about other ways to achieve [man-computer symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-Computer_Symbiosis).

Previously, I've worked on projects ranging from [decentralized preventive healthcare](https://hea.care), [modular bioreactors](https://www.dynacyte.com/) and [swarm robotics platforms](https://github.com/makerforceio/Sentibots).

### A primer on this site
This site consists of [[top-of-mind|notes]] and [letters](/letters). Notes are shorter, scrap-work style wikis, held together by an associative link graph. Letters are more thoughtful and longer-form work which are standalone pieces of writing.

**Maybe start here?**
