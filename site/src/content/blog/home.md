**This website is a memex**, a tool for thought that helps me ingress, link and process information. Think of this as a scratchbook, personal notes, musings, resume and knowledge base, all rolled into a single place.

_(for the uninitiated, I recommend [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/) by Vannevar Bush)_.

I find joy in intertwining threads between the disciplines, and need a malleable framework to help me handle those thoughts. Systems like Notion and Obsidian provide a few choice strategies, but each mind thinks uniquely. What better way to express myself than to lovingly handcraft the experience of being inside my own head?

# Who am I?

<img src="/pfp-min.png" class="w-36 h-36" />

Welcome weary internet traveller, you might know me as Shan / **solderneer** / or if you know me really well _Sudharshan Sundaramahlingam_.

**Evolutionary Purpose:** To spread love and optimism by nudging the world towards a path of collective flourishing.

**Top of Mind:** I‚Äôm working on a community-centered approach to preventive healthcare with [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care/).

_Chronological is tired. Categorical is wired._ I tend to hop around industries and themes, chasing what I believe is a deeper thematic problem in the world. So, what follows is my life, decomposed into defined and far more legible categories.

## _Projects & Products_

- **Space:** designed and built a prototype [STM32 based cube satellite](https://github.com/solderneer/ARMsat), for the EG1310 module at the National University of Singapore in 2017. I also gave [a short talk](https://engineers.sg/video/tm32-based-nanosatellite-project-hackware-v3-14159--1773) about it, at Hackware v3.14.
- **Robotics:** with my friend, Isaac Tay, I worked on a swarm robotics platform called [Sentibots](https://github.com/solderneer/Sentibots). The project was was a finalist in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2016, and was formally published at the IRC-SET 2016 conference.
- **Embedded Systems:** made a [custom 16-bit microprocessor](https://github.com/solderneer/artemis) on a Xilinx FPGA, complete with its own instruction set architecture. And, as always, talked about this at Hackware. I also worked on automated embedded system verification and testing pipelines for warehouse robots at Hope Technik
- **Security:** contributed to a embedded-friendly certificate management system at MicroSec and worked on client side interface design and development for the their. Intrusion Detection System
- **Full-stack Software:**
  - Built [sellingx.io](http://sellingx.io) to facilitate peer-to-peer resale of student clubbing tickets alongside Daniel. In 5 days, we had **600 daily active users** and moved about 300 pounds of money‚Ä¶. then Stripe deplatformed us for violating their Terms of Service.
  - During National Service, I developed military software infrastructure including internal booking/tracking systems and a custom educational platform. **Some** of [the work](https://github.com/digital-okra) is ‚ú®¬†open source ‚ú®.
- **Tech for good**: worked on a sonar powered wearable that uses haptic feedback to help to the visually impaired, during a local hackathon (Hack n Roll).
- **Hackathons**:
- **Misc. projects for fun:**
  - An FPGA audio synthesiser
  - Real time visualization tool for neural network training
  - _Kerbal Space Program_ hardware gaming console

## _Startups_

- **Happily Ever After:** building on my research into healthcare systems, and the complex adaptive nature of individual well-being, [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care/) is building grassroots infrastructure for a network of community-centered health and well-being spaces.
- **Beep:** a [voice-first chat application](https://beepvoice.app/) that used AI transcription and voice generation to provide two-way interoperability between audio and text communication. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt manage to get it to scale, but the real alpha was the experience we gained, and the friendships I forged (Ambrose Chua, Daniel).

## _Research & Writing_

- **Health & Human Flourishing:** interweaving technological, social, cultural, economical, philosophical and spiritual dimensions of delivering holistic healthcare. Unravelling the threads that underpin healthcare coordination failure, and advocating for human-centered sociotechnologies to power the future of human flourishing. I write about this actively on [The Pink Zone](https://heacare.substack.com).
- **Biotechnology:** still fascinated by the civilisational unlock of brain-computer interface tech. Gave a [couple of](https://engineers.sg/video/openbci-an-introduction-to-brain-computer-interfaces-hackware-v5-5-x-stackx--3629) [talks](https://engineers.sg/video/love-at-first-byte-a-romantic-journey-into-the-future-of-us-geekcampsg-2019--3718) on their importance, the OpenBCI platform and its limitations.
- **Education:** spent 6 months deeply exploring alternate realities around preserving meaning in educational systems, a preference for academies over universities and protocols to encourage life-long learning. During this time, I [built knowledge graphs](https://github.com/axiomacademy/content-loader), a [digital microuniversity](https://github.com/axiomacademy/solo), and a [thought-apprentice matching system](https://github.com/axiomacademy/v0.1-student-app). Wrote about some of the ideas [here](https://makerforce.io/learning-used-to-be-fun/), [here](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/) and [here](https://makerforce.io/do-you-need-to-be-taught-to-teach/). _Done in collaboration and with support from [Audacity](https://audacity.world), a Singapore based impact collective._
- **Some of my hits that I‚Äôm especially proud of:**
  - [Technology‚Äôs ultimate purpose is vitality](https://heacare.substack.com/p/technologys-ultimate-purpose-is-vitality)
  - [Insurance shouldn‚Äôt wash cars](https://heacare.substack.com/p/insurance-shouldnt-wash-cars)
  - [Institutionalized Learning](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/)

## _Communities_

- **President of [UCL Entrepreneurs](https://ucle.co):** a student society with over 1000 ambitious members who are passionate about pursuring entrepreneurship as a career.
- **Community Steward at [Audacity](https://audacity.world):** an impact collective based in Singapore which focuses on a values-based culture to solve issues in communities, food, energy, work, education, healthcare and urbanisation.
- **Kernel Block 7 Fellow at [Kernel](https://kernel.community/):** a peer-to-peer lifelong network of awesome individuals building and learning about web3.
- **Cohort 2 at Colony DAO Club:** a group of active DAO builders working on using organizational technology to solve civic problems.
- **[Dev #752](https://rainbow.me/solderneer.eth?nft=ethereum_0x25ed58c027921e14d86380ea2646e3a1b5c55a8b_752) at [DeveloperDAO](https://www.developerdao.com/)**

## _Personal Culture_

- **Words:** I read, like I _read read_, literally everything. Favourite blogs include Slate Star Codex, Not Boring, Ex Urbe, Ribbonfarm, Subpixel Space. Favourite books include ‚ÄúGodel, Escher, Bach‚Äù, Braiding Sweetgrass, Reinventing Organizations, and Thinking Fast and Slow.
- **Coffee:** Training to be an amateur barista, one pour at a time. I‚Äôm not going anywhere without my Baratza Encore, Aeropress and a bag of kiss the hippo‚Äôs _George Street Blend_.
- **Fitness and Longevity:** I dealt with an eating disorder as a teenager, and so I care very deeply about the well-being of my mind, body and soul. I do regular calisthenics, stick to a 16-8 intermittent fast and try my best to eat foods that are full of life _(a hard ask for a student)._
