People who have known me since 2016 would know that I have had a hell of a relationship with health and my body. Part of why I am working on a [preventive health project](https://hea.care/) at the moment, is that I have struggled with body dysmorphia and health issues for a large part of my life. That's why people who meet me after a long time, often find themselves quite shocked at how much I have changed- both on the outside and on the inside with my perspectives on human well-being.
