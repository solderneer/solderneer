**Dearest Reader,**

Today, I listened to a fascinating podcast episode between [Mark Zuckerberg and Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ff4fRgnuFgQ). A lot of the conversation was around personal LLMs, and Meta's vision for open-source models, but one quote in particular stood out to me.

When Lex asked Mark, "How do you choose who you hire?", Mark responded almost instantly. **"You just hire people you wouldn't mind working for."**

And that's genius. You wouldn't want to work for someone who wasn't nice, ambitious, did good work, inspiring etc. The filter of do-you-mind-working-for-them, is a neat way of wrapping up that bundle of concepts in a way that can be very quickly evaluated.

Anyway, that's it for now, just amazement at the surprising effectiveness of simple heuristics. Have a good day :)
