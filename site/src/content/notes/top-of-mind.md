My name is [Shan / Sudharshan / சுதர்சன்](https://solderneer.me/). Currently, I’m working on silent speech interfaces and human-machine interaction at [[clay|Clay]], backed by [1517 fund](https://www.1517fund.com/).

I'm passionate about human-computer interaction, neural interfaces, bio-signals, consumer wearable hardware, and anything cybernetic.  
  
Previously, I studied Electrical Engineering at [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk), and have worked on a variety of technical projects ranging from [decentralized preventive healthcare](https://heacare.substack.com/p/networks-work-in-healthcare-and-beyond), [modular bioreactors](https://www.dynacyte.com/) and [swarm robotics platforms](https://github.com/makerforceio/Sentibots).
