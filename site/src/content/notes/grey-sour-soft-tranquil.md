Glitter droplets from grey lit skies  
Sliding down her crow black hair  
Past her mystifying eyes  
Down her quivering soft lips  
And clinging her flower shirt to her skin  

She gasps when she hears his laugh loud  
And winces at tasting the salt tears of clouds  
But suddenly everything was tranquil  
Sour feelings gone, so thankful  
Cause she knew she had found him  

He who was jealous  
Jealous of the rain that touched her skin
