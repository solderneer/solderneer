**Dearest Reader,**

I am happy today!

First things first, my results for the second year at university came out, and I performed far beyond my wildest expectations. I owe my partner and flatmates who supported me through the exam period a massive thank you!! I'm also grateful to all of the professors, mentors and course mates who made my second year so enriching ðŸ’—.

And thanks to our newest healer in [Happily Ever After](https://hea.care/), I had a tarot card reading for the first time. I would like to share it with you as well, it's a reminder to dance with joy.

I'm not going to drag this letter on, I think it's time for me to relax and celebrate. If you'd like, join me and do a lil happy dance, but otherwise have an amazing day :)

~ Shan
