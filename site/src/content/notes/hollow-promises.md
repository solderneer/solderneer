Pair of souls, drifting in a gentle stream  
Birdsong echoes, dewdrops gleam in the golden rays of spring sun  
Flowers blossom and trees wave in the gentle breeze, as he says  
You're the one  
You're the one I'll be with, forever  
  
She simply smiles, wistful  
For she knows, promises in peace ring hollow  
And that, attachment brings sorrow  
Once the currents shift and the tides turn  
In the stream once, so small  
The gentle trickle to a deafening roar  
The tides of time test us all  
  
A colossal waterfall looms at the horizon  
Raging whitewaters hurrying them along  
Scrabbling for air, land, each other, hope  
Please... with her I belong  
  
God sends them a rock  
Repulsive, jagged and jutting out of the whites  
She grabs on, fighting for her life  
He grabs her, fighting for his life  
Only, his life was her, he was fighting for her  
Whilst she was fighting for herself  
  
It’s his turn to smile now  
Promises were made to be kept, anyhow  
She’s slipping, time’s ticking...  
  
He lets go  
His forever now over  
But hers  
Ticking on
