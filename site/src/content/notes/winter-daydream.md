Winter daydream  
Are you my lucky charm  
With your sun kissed cheeks and lip balm  
You make the grey clouds glow and  
Light up the sky  
But only I seem to see them  
I’m not sure why  

Never heard you speak  
Or seen your smiles  
Or walked with you for miles and miles  
Never touched your face  
Or cupped your cheeks  
But I yearn to keep you by me  

For weeks  
For…. ever?  

No seriously what’s this feeling  
Warmth, light, and high  
Like I’m floating in the sky  
Please don’t be a lie  
Please don’t go, stay  

Are you a reflection  
Maybe it’s all in my head  
How else would you know about  
Those things I never said  

Halfway round the world  
I just wish I could see  
Your hopes, your dreams  
And what you think of me  

So tell me Ms Daydream  
Are you messing with my mind  
You feel so unreal you’re way too kind    
Figment of imagination  
Perfect hallucination  

But if you’re here  
If all this real  
Oh help me god  
For I’m starting to feel  
Starting to fall  
For a winter daydream
