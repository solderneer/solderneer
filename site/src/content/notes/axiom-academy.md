Spent 6 months deeply exploring alternate realities around preserving meaning in educational systems, a preference for academies over universities and protocols to encourage life-long learning. During this time, I [built knowledge graphs](https://github.com/axiomacademy/content-loader), a [digital microuniversity](https://github.com/axiomacademy/solo), and a [thought-apprentice matching system](https://github.com/axiomacademy/v0.1-student-app). Wrote about some of the ideas [here](https://makerforce.io/learning-used-to-be-fun/), [here](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/) and [here](https://makerforce.io/do-you-need-to-be-taught-to-teach/).

_Done in collaboration and with support from [Audacity](https://audacity.world/), a Singapore based impact collective._
