1. **Organisation as a Machine:** This is the most simple metaphor and the foundation of [Taylorism](https://www.britannica.com/science/Taylorism) with words like _bottom_up_, _top_down_ and _centralized_. Pretty much everything wrong with industrial work.
2. **Organisation as an Organism:** A richer metaphor with ideas like evolution, birth and death
3. **Organisation as a Brain:** Some overlap with the organism metaphor, but it is an information-theoretic way of understanding collectives. About building collective intelligence.
4. **Organisation as a Culture:** Related to a sense of shared meaning and purpose
5. **Organisation as Political System:** Discussed in [[The Gervais Principle, or the Office According to ‚ÄúThe Office‚Äù]].
6. **Organisation as a Psychic Prison:** Something like a plato's cave, haven't sufficiently explored this.
7. **Organisation as a System of Change and Flux:** My favourite language of complex adaptive systems, stability, entropy and chaos theory.
8. **Organisation as Instrument of Domination:** These are themes of oppression, naked aggression, bigger army diplomacy, rules for rulers.
