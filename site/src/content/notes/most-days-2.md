**Dearest Reader,**

Welcome to another Monday, and I wish for a beautiful week ahead in your life. This letter is going to be another progress checkin, similar to [[most-days]], where I review the goals that I had set at the start of summer. We're now about a month into summer, and there are some big changes in my summer plans that I have to account for.

Most importantly, I started a new internship with Dynacyte this month (I talk more about this in [[homecoming]]), which means I have less time to focus on my goals. In general, it's become clearer to me that I don't have bandwidth for some of my goals, so I will be stripping some of them out.

**Goal 1:** I am really enjoying the [[104-days-of-summer-vacation]] experiment, and using writing as a tool to process my thoughts. I've managed to remain consistent with it, and I'm happy with my progress so far.

**Goal 2:** I think I definitely won't have the bandwidth to do this, so I will be dropping this goal. Instead I'll focus all my writing energy into [[104-days-of-summer-vacation]] and try to get out some higher quality letters as well.

**Goal 3:** As I expected, the India trip threw my routine into whack with regards to the [[90-day-transformation]] project. But, I've managed to claw my routine back this week, and I will write an update on the project tomorrow.

**Goal 4:** Progress on the Happily Ever After website has stalled, because of my internship. I'm not dropping the goal but I think I need to pay more attention to it.

**Goal 5:** I haven't started on it yet, like I mentioned in [[most-days]], but I will be starting on it now that I'm back from India.

**Goal 6:** I'm going to drop this goal for now, because I don't have bandwidth for it. Perhaps I'll consider picking it up when some of my other goals are cleared.

**Goal 7 and 8:** I wrote about my thoughts on networking recently in [[thoughtful-networking]]. Building on that,  I want to adopt a different approach to these goals. Instead of attending networking events, I'll try to be mindful with my existing connections instead. For a start.

**Goal 9:** I need to apply for more grants and programs now that I am back.

**Goal 10:** This is going well, we have our first meeting this Wednesday!
