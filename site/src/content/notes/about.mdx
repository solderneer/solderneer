This page is a log of what I've already done. If you're curious about what I'm doing right now, look at what's at the [[top-of-mind|top of my mind]].
And to learn more about why I do what I do, read about my [evolutionary purpose](/letters/answer-the-call/).

_Chronological is tired. Categorical is wired._ I tend to hop around industries and themes, chasing interdisciplinary problems that span multiple types of work. So, what follows is my life, decomposed into somewhat legible categories.

## _Startups_

<Callout emoji="üöÄ" color="bg-violet-50">Companies that I've founded.</Callout>

[[clay|Clay]]: Building silent speech interfaces, by fusing vibration sensors, bio-signals and audio to detect ultra-quiet whispers in any environment. Backed by [1517 fund](https://www.1517fund.com/).

[[happily-ever-after|Happily Ever After]]: Venture built a preventive healthcare startup at [Mistletoe](https://mistletoe.co/), which used wearable data + actuarial data to provide proactive health advice.

Gathered a group of 100+ health professionals, built a sleep improvement app in collaboration with researchers from the [NUS Sleep and Cognition Lab](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/csc/research-labs/sleep-and-cognition-laboratory/), and designed a [[networks-work-in-healthcare-and-beyond|decentralized healthcare system]] based on Cuba and community networks.

[Beep](https://beepvoice.app/): a voice-first chat application that used AI transcription and voice generation to provide two-way interoperability between audio and text communication.

## _Technical Work_

<Callout emoji="üíú" color="bg-violet-50">Technical projects that I‚Äôve contributed to.</Callout>

**Neurotech**: 

- Researched and developed a novel multiplexed star electrode array to address the challenges of cross-session variability in silent speech recognition systems. Paper and technical documentation available [here](https://github.com/solderneer/nexus-silent-speech).
- Won 2nd place at the IEEE BR41N hackathon, building a system to [convert emotions into live music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjq22Odtjs) with EEG.

**Biotech:** contributed to modular bioreactors at [Dynacyte](https://www.dynacyte.com/). Helped to redesign their cloud IoT backend with MQTT, boosting reliability and reducing command lag times by **10x**.

**Space:** designed and built a [STM32 based cube satellite](https://github.com/solderneer/ARMsat), for the EG1310 module at the National University of Singapore in 2017. I also gave [a short talk](https://engineers.sg/video/tm32-based-nanosatellite-project-hackware-v3-14159--1773) about it, at Hackware v3.14.

**Robotics:** with my friend, [Isaac Tay](https://github.com/IsaacTay), I worked on a swarm robotics platform called [Sentibots](https://github.com/solderneer/Sentibots). The project was was a finalist in the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair 2016, and was formally published at the IRC-SET 2016 conference.

**Embedded Systems:**

- Made a [custom 16-bit microprocessor](https://github.com/solderneer/artemis) on a Xilinx FPGA, complete with its own instruction set architecture. And, as always, [talked about this at Hackware](https://engineers.sg/video/custom-designed-16-bit-processor-in-a-xilinx-fpga--2517). 
- Worked on automated embedded system verification and testing pipelines for warehouse robots at [Hope Technik](https://www.hopetechnik.com/).
- Contributed to a embedded-friendly certificate management system at [MicroSec](https://www.usec.io/).

**Software:**

- Maintaining [AI Tools for Obsidian](https://github.com/solderneer/obsidian-ai-tools), an plugin that adds powerful semantic and generative search to Obsidian. It has 200+ ‚≠ê on GitHub!
- Built [sellingx.io](http://sellingx.io) to facilitate peer-to-peer resale of student clubbing tickets. In 5 days, we had **600 daily active users** and moved about 300 pounds of money‚Ä¶. then Stripe deplatformed us for violating their Terms of Service.
- During National Service, I developed military software infrastructure including internal booking/tracking systems and a custom educational platform.
- Did client side interface design and development for the [MicroSec](https://www.usec.io/) Intrusion Detection System.

**Tech for good:** worked on a sonar powered wearable that uses haptic feedback to help to the visually impaired, during a local hackathon (Hack n Roll).

**Random websites:**
- [colorga.me](https://colorga.me/) - a fun game to do with colors
- [Color Me](https://colorme.solderneer.me/) - a personality test, you guessed it, also based on colors

**Misc. projects for fun:**

- [An FPGA audio synthesiser](https://github.com/solderneer/Synthesia)
- [Real time visualization tool for neural network training](https://github.com/makerforceio/nviz)
- [_Kerbal Space Program_ hardware gaming console](https://makerforce.io/the-ksp-command-station-2/)

## _Writing & Talks_

<Callout emoji="üß†" color="bg-violet-50">Deep thoughts, wicked problems, design fictions, essays and creativity.</Callout>

**Neurotech:** 
- Gave a talk about magical technologies at [This Next Thing 2024](https://2024.thisnextthing.com/speakers).
- Talked about silent speech as a human-machine interface at [Foresight Vision Weekend 2023](https://foresight.org/vw2023fr-agenda/).
- Gave a [couple of](https://engineers.sg/video/openbci-an-introduction-to-brain-computer-interfaces-hackware-v5-5-x-stackx--3629) [talks](https://engineers.sg/video/love-at-first-byte-a-romantic-journey-into-the-future-of-us-geekcampsg-2019--3718) on the OpenBCI platform and its limitations.

**Education:** spent 6 months deeply exploring alternate realities around preserving meaning in educational systems, a preference for academies over universities and protocols to encourage life-long learning. During this time, I [built knowledge graphs](https://github.com/axiomacademy/content-loader), a [digital microuniversity](https://github.com/axiomacademy/solo), and a [thought-apprentice matching system](https://github.com/axiomacademy/v0.1-student-app). Wrote about some of the ideas [here](https://makerforce.io/learning-used-to-be-fun/), [here](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/) and [here](https://makerforce.io/do-you-need-to-be-taught-to-teach/). _Done in collaboration and with support from [Audacity](https://audacity.world), a Singapore based impact collective._

**Some of my writing that I‚Äôm especially proud of:**

- [Technology‚Äôs ultimate purpose is vitality](https://heacare.substack.com/p/technologys-ultimate-purpose-is-vitality)
- [Insurance shouldn‚Äôt wash cars](https://heacare.substack.com/p/insurance-shouldnt-wash-cars)
- [Institutionalized Learning](https://makerforce.io/institutionalised-learning/)

## _Communities_

**President of [UCL Entrepreneurs](https://ucle.co):** a student society where I worked with 30 executives to serve over 1000 ambitious members who are passionate about pursuring entrepreneurship as a career.

**Community Steward at [Audacity](https://audacity.world):** an impact collective based in Singapore which focuses on a values-based culture to solve issues in communities, food, energy, work, education, healthcare and urbanisation.

**Kernel Block 7 Fellow at [Kernel](https://kernel.community/):** a peer-to-peer learning network of awesome individuals.

Founding member at [Makerforce](https://makerforce.io): a small collective of developers, makers and thinkers from NUS High School, who love to build stuff.

## _Personal Culture_

**Words:** I _love_ to read. Favourite blogs include [Astral Codex Ten](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/), [Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/), [Ex Urbe](https://www.exurbe.com/about/), [Ribbonfarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/), [Subpixel Space](https://subpixel.space/). Favourite books include [Godel, Escher, Bach](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Godel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden/dp/0465026567), [Braiding Sweetgrass](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465709-braiding-sweetgrass), [Reinventing Organizations](https://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/en/), and [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0141033576).

**Coffee:** Training to be an amateur barista, one pour at a time. I‚Äôm not going anywhere without my Baratza Encore, Aeropress and a bag of [kiss the hippo‚Äôs _George Street Blend_](https://kissthehippo.com/collections/coffee).

**Fitness and Longevity:** I dealt with an eating disorder as a teenager, and so I care very deeply about the well-being of my mind, body and soul. I gym regularly, stick to a 16-8 intermittent fast and try my best to eat foods that are full of life.

_and just to round it off, I also play chess badly, watch lots of trashy romantic comedies, and occasionally write poetry._
