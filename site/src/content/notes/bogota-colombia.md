I visited [[Bogota, Colombia]] to attend [[Devcon VI]] - which is one of the biggest [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) conferences held annually. The city itself is beautifully situated in a valley surrounded by mountains, which meant some pretty cool views. Since I was only there for a conference, unfortunately, most of my time was actually spent at the [[Devcon VI]] conference center.

But the conference really outdid itself by serving local cuisine and attempting to immerse its attendees in the culture. Somewhat disappointingly, I am not a fan of Colombian cuisine, and food is so important to me that this alone is a dealbreaker for me visiting again for leisure.

Similar to [[Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam]], [[Bogota, Colombia]] is filled with a vibrant, chaotic energy: the Colombians at [[Devcon VI]] were all incredible in their own unique ways. This to me really shows me the potential in developing regions like Latin America and South East Asia.
