I think about tools—not just their function, but the way they shape us. My favourite tools are extensions of thought: precise, responsive, alive in my hand. A soldering iron, a pencil, an electric screwdriver humming with purpose. There’s magic in the way a good tool bridges what is and what could be.

The human brain is fragile and extraordinary, and capable of things we barely understand. What if our tools were as adaptable as our mind? What if our tools didn't connect us to machines, but to each other? 

What if our tools could make us better at being human?
