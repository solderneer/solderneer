in the quiet, my heart whispers dreams  
softly (afraid to dream out loud)  
but my heart’s song sings  
  
dreaming out loud  
is bravest, true  
and in the gentle moments of night  
my heart (quietly) tells me  
to trust only the journey which is mine,  
drape myself in dream song  
for in hope there will be, fear  
and loving wholly is partly unknowing  
  
whispered dreams wither  
while dreams out loud (echo and)  
conspire with the universe  
to reality the whispered dreams  
out loud that were said
