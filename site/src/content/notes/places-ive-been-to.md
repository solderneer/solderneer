**Being in countries where no one understands me, teaches me to listen.** And as I experience these countries, I listen for new perspectives, observe different ways of doing the same things and learn to appreciate the multitudes of the world we live in.

Currently I'm based at [[uk-london|London, UK]].

Other places I've been:

- [[sg-singapore]]
- Cambridge, UK
- [[austria-vienna]]
- [[hochiminh-vietnam]]
- [[colombia-bogota]]
