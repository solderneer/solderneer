**Being in countries where no one understands me, teaches me to listen.** And as I experience these countries, I listen for new perspectives, observe different ways of doing the same things and learn to appreciate the multitudes of the world we live in.

Currently I'm based at [[uk-london|London, UK]].

Other places I've been:

- [[sg-singapore|Singapore, Singapore]]
- [[Cambridge, United Kingdom]]
- [[austria-vienna|Vienna, Austria]]
- [[Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam]]
- [[colombia-bogota|Bogota, Colombia]]
- [[indonesia-bali|Bali, Indonesia]]
- [[Bonn, Germany]]
- [[Virudhunagar, India]]
- [[Madurai, India]]
- [[Chennai, India]]
- [[Johor Bahru, Malaysia]]
- [[Kuala Lampur, Malaysia]]
- [[Genting, Malysia]]
- [[uk-birmingham|Birmingham, UK]]
