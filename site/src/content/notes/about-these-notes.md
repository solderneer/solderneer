Hello, my name is [Shan](https://solderneer.me), and these are my personal notes that are used to incubate and grow all of my strange ideas and musings. Althought they are primarily intended as a personal reference, I like the idea of treating this as a public garden which is open for anyone to take a stroll through.

I first stumbled into the idea of [digital gardening](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) while doing research on ways to nurture and my knowledge and I was almost immediately drawn to this idea of hyperlinks as a tool to represent associative webs of thought. **A densely hyperlinked set of notes that slowly grows over time feels strangely alive and organic.

I have always found myself frustrated by how much knowledge I lose to time, and my hypothesis in this experiment is that by deeply integrating new knowledge into existing associative webs, I might be able to boost retention and leverage my knowledge better. 

The themes of these notes generally revolve around the topics I am interested in, which means they are constantly shifting in time. Currently, expect to find notes about things like:

- 💻  Web3 and the decentralized web
- 🥳  Culture and Brands
- 💡  Electrical Engineering
- 🏋‍♂  Health, Wellness and Quantified Self
- 🌱  Self-improvement and personal growth
