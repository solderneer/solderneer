# What are social organisms

- Ants
- humans

Social organisms live in societies. Where the individual is composed of communities and the communities are composed of individuals.
Emergent phenomenon happens in these organisms and there is almost an emergent organism that behaves in interesting ways from the collective actions of its
constituents.

Referring to the article from Godel, Escher, Bach on emergent behaviour in ant colonies

Similar emergent phenomenon happens in humans as well where the emergent behaviour of humanity is programmed by the value system and actions of individual humans. Noah Hararri ralks about this- morals and religion are software for humanity that lets us program the behaviour of aggregates of humans.

A similar idea is that of Idea machines. "Idea operators" are similar to founders of "startup cities".

[Pascal's Mugging](https://patrickjuli.us/2019/11/10/pascals-mugging/)

And network states

And they talk about the "one commandment" or one moral innovation that improves aggregate behaviour in a certain way. Installing a module into humanity.

But the network state emphasises something additional. Cryptohistory.

# Cybersocial organisms

Previously. Humans --- idea ---> human and we had small communities with radically different moral ideas.

is about making decisions on collective wisdom, collective consciousness etc.

> H.G. Wells's concept of "world brain", as described in his book of essays with the same title
> Ã‰mile Durkheim argues in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1912) that society by definition constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time, thereby achieving collective wisdom.
> Dave Pollard's restatement of Collective wisdom: "Many cognitive, coordination and cooperation problems are best solved by canvassing groups (the larger the better) of reasonably informed, unbiased, engaged people. The group's answer is almost invariably much better than any individual expert's answer, even better than the best answer of the experts in the group."

After industrialization, we invented loudspeakers like newspapers and the state which magnified the ideas and messaging of some people.

- The New York Times
- The US State Apparatus
- Capitalism, Communism, Nazism etc.

Invented mechanisms to facilitate decision making, allocation of scarce resources

Human to many humand creating schools of thought. Fundamentally it remains an extension of social organisms except with a hirerarchy structure.

And with social networks stuff changes. The distribution strategy of ideas became entangled with technology and algorithms. humans -- technology --> certain other humans

and the technology was changing us and we were changing the technology. technology codes the behaviour of people who code technology. a self referential loop.

Things are going to get interesting.

# Recursive organisms

A self-referential loop can be positive or negative feedback. Postitive feedback accelerates the splitting of social order. Think trump and hillary. Red and blue. Think the ideas of https://www.notboring.co/p/amplified-tribalism Negative feedback curbs extremism and pushes people into having a broad, open minded view of the world. Think soulbound tokens, quadratic voting etc.

When people increasingly rely on AI's to make those decisions for them as well. Increasing outsourcing of actions to AI.

We are already cyborgs - we are worse navigators than the previous generation but we have google maps
we listen to music on devices plugged into our ears
we connect with people across the world instantaenously over social networks

# What have cybersocial organisms accomplished so far

These are with networks

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Capitol_attack
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests or other global phenomenon protests
- Any globally coordinated action using twitter, facebook or digital technology

Those with economics as well

- bitcoin

# Public data vs Private data

- Private Data makes cybersocial organisms less efficient
- If all data is public the entire organism is able to function with perfect information
- If data is private, individuals have more agency and control

# How to you create cybersocial organisms with interesting emergent behaviour

DAOs are attempts at engineering the behaviour of cybersocial organisms. Provide a medium for communication and a medium for directionality and the cybersocial organism does the rest. Similar to the Market-Protocol fit idea i talked about in a previous post.

Bitcoin is a cyber-social organism that preserves the security of the coin. Graph Protocol is a cybersocial organism

Tokenomics comes in here.
Incentive mechanisms are important.
Information is important.
Direction is important.
Advancements in governance mechanisms.
