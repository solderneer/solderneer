I've always been a believer in building the futures that you want to see. Visionaries and dreamers have defined innovation culture in the startup ecosystem of the last 3 decades. In fact, we find ourselves in a world where cult founder personalities are aplenty, look no further than Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

This makes sense. Elon Musk's vision for affordable electric cars, and his drive to bring that vision to reality is what gave us Tesla. The company mission was always driven top-down by what Elon Musk wanted for the future. Tesla was an extension of Elon Musk's ambition. The recipe for creating successful startups is based on this ideal- start with a visionary founding team, and then execute that vision, iterating as you go along.

# Founders -> Product/Market Fit

In this era of startups, there is one mantra that rules above all: [product-market fit](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html). The founders have one job, to build a product that people want and that gets them closer to the vision they want. The founder are responsible for finding the market, building the product, and creating the future. Marc Andreessen wrote in his 2007 blog:

> In a great market—a market with lots of real potential customers—the market pulls product out of the startup.
