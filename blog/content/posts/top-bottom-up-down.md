Visionaries and dreamers have defined innovation culture in the startup ecosystem of the last 3 decades. In fact, we find ourselves in a world where cult founder personalities are aplenty, look no further than Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.

This makes sense. Elon Musk's vision for affordable electric cars, and his drive to bring that vision to reality is what gave us Tesla. The company's mission was always driven top-down by what Elon Musk wanted for the future. In a sense, Tesla was an extension of Elon's ambition. The recipe for creating successful startups is generally based on this ideal- start with a visionary founding team, and then execute that vision, iterating and pivoting on ideas as you go along.

# Founders -> Product/Market Fit

In this era of startups, there is one mantra that rules above all: [product-market fit](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html). The founders have to build something that gets them closer to their vision, yes, but more importantly, they have to build a product that people want. The founders are responsible for finding the market, building the product, and creating the future. Marc Andreessen wrote in his [2007 blog](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html):

> In a great market—a market with lots of real potential customers—the market pulls product out of the startup.

The calculus is simple: find a good market with a vision for a better future, and then build in that direction for success. And it worked brilliantly, bringing [a16z](https://a16z.com/) some of the most successful software startups on the planet.

# Introducing... Web 3

Web 3 envisions the reality of startups to be profoundly different. Powered by values of wide ownership, decentralization and open source, founders and central control are considered a liability in the new internet. Web 3 proponents point to the gradually extrative nature of Web 2 founders and startups, who eventually turn from helping their users to exploiting them for investor and personal profit. In contrast, Web 3 believes in community ownership to limit extractive motives from the core fouding and investing team, which also limits the power the core founding team has to change their own product. Proprietary and closed software- exit stage left.

Furthermore, the computational primitives of the blockchain enable new governance and corporate structure paradigms. On-chain governance and its associated utility programs enable web-native democratic activity, unlocking global scale cooeration. Founders no longer have to make all the decisions for their vision, the decision making power can be transferred to those who believe in their narrative and (literally) buy into their vision. Founders can simply promise- that the future they envision is possible. And, encoding this promise is the fungible, programmable ERC-20 token. With this primitive, a challenger to product-market fit is born: market-protocol fit.

# Products vs Protocols

Before we look at market-protocol fit, it is essential to understand the [key differences between protocols and products](https://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/).

Let's look at products first. Products are user-friendly, focus on implementation and aim to achieve a monoculture- a world where everyone uses the product. In contrast, protocols are open, built for developers, are composable and focus on achieving a diversity of applications that sit on top of them. For a more practical example, consider XMPP, the open messaging protocol and Signal which is a product built on proprietary (albeit extremely privacy focused) software. Protocols develop a lot slower than products as they cannot evolve at the same speed as a LEAN product team. However, protocols are generally more robust and have the potential to generate a pluralistic future with a diversity of composable applications.

Ethereum is a great example of a successful developer protocol. It is open source, permissionless and allows developers to build vibrant services and applications on top of it- Uniswap, Compound, Balancer etc. It is well documented, cares about interoperability, software diversity and decentralization.

Fundamentally, the core ideals of web 3 are decentralization, ownership and composability. This means, web 3 is about _protocols, not products._

# Progressive decentralization

We can start by trying to apply the product-market fit strategy to protocols. Let us use Uniswap as a practical illustration.

1. Define a problem [Uniswap: it is hard to swap tokens]
2. Have a vision [Uniswap: people can easily swap between any token, ever present liquidity]
3. Build an MVP [Uniswap: Automated Market Maker v1]
4. Iterate and test and build [Uniswap: raise venture funds to pay contributors]
5. Release the protocol

But recall, the two of the core ideals of web 3 are decentralization and ownership. But herein lies the problem, Uniswap likely wouldn't have been able to build Uniswap so quickly if it was decentralized, at least not as rapidly. Firstly, it is hard to achieve consensus on a vision amidst a large group of people. Even if that's possible, it is even harder to agree on a single approach to achieve that vision. Lastly, in large groups, no individual feels full ownership and responsibility, and coaxing this group to build and iterate requires a lot more effort than in a small LEAN team with more at stake.

In essence, smaller teams move faster, iterate quicker and converge on a solution even if the solution is a local minima which isn't the most optimal. Convincing large communities to achieve this directionality is quite impossible. A comparison can be drawn to a gradient descent operation. When a small team can quickly agree on the shape of the design space, they can quickly find a local minima to move towards. But in a large team, the landscape of the design space is fuzzy and not globally agreed upon, leading to a lot more difficulties in deciding which way to move.

This has led many startups and VCs to reccomend progressive decentralization. Find product-market fit, and then introduce governance and handover control to the community. The order goes product/protocol-market fit -> build a community -> transition to a decentralized protocol.

It is also possible to use the mental model that [token-based protocols are just special forms of products](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/should-product-market-fit-come-before-tokens-6c542a75c8dc)- namely the combination of a multi-sided platform and an open-source project.

> Token-based products combine ideas of multi-sided platform products and open-source projects. This is great news, because we don’t need to radically reinvent “product”, or chase something different than “PMF”.
>
> -Trent McConaghy

The Market-Protocol Fit approach disagrees with this strategy.

# Market-Protocol Fit

If progressive decentralization is intentional, directional movement downhill, market-protocol fit is pouring water over the entire surface and seeing where lakes form. It is like an evolutionary algorithm, where there is no control over individual agents.

> As such, top-level behavior must be an emergent property of bottom-up actions by agents. This is necessary for tokenized ecosystems; otherwise they’d be centralized!

In other words, market-protocol fit approaches the problem by thinking about cryptoeconomic protocols as market frameworks looking for product applications. In this decentralized format, the market looks for the product that fits its needs, market-product fit. This is achieved by first and foremost, distributing tokens to a wide number of peoples along with a narrative or a guiding mission. Then, proper governance mechanisms and economic incentives are put in place to reward parallel explorations of the design space that achieve this narrative. Then:

> The work of exploring parallel narratives, discovering emergent use cases, and testing solutions is distributed among members of the wider ecosystem such that the rising tide lifts all boats.

In market-protocol fit, the founder does not have sole responsibility to find solutions to the problem. They only need to convince the community that this is a problem worth finding solutions for, and that the rewards from this will be plentiful. Ethereum is a great example of this in action, it's prevailing narrative was to become a "world computer" leading to many developers building solutions on top of it that made it a world computer. (althought along the way it has pivoted to become money-lego)

# So it's all just narratives, always was

# Progressive decentralization vs Market-Protocol Fit

In many ways, progressive decentralization and market protocol fit are diammetrically opposed. Progressice decentralization preaches focus, rapid iteration and a small team, while market-protocol fit heralds decentralization, parallel pluralistic exploration and slower movement. Progressive decentralization can quickly converge on a solution. Market-Protocol fit is more likely to find a globally optimal solution to the goal. Progressive decentralization wants a monoculture of people using their solution to the problem. Market-Protocol fit wants a diverse range of solutions for the problem to be present.

So which one do you pick? Which one is better, or right? Well, it depends...

_Are you solving an existing obvious problem_?

# Yes, I am

Great! Go with progressive decentralization. When your problem is obvious [Uniswap: lack of token liquidity], it is easy to find direction, get customer feedback, have a LEAN team, iterate quick and solve the problem. And once you have solved the problem, achieve market fit and have a community, the product can be decentralized and handed over to your community.

By far, this is the easier answer to the question.

# No, I don't think sohttps://snikket.org/blog/products-vs-protocols/

Welcome to the abyss known as "solution looking for a problem". This is where VCs like a16z, ycombinator and others shun a project for being cool but not having any real market need... yet. Don't worry, you are still amidst legends when bitcoin was invented, normal money was working just fine. Ethereum critics still think that it is useless and nothing more than a crappy database. When you're a solution looking for a problem, you just have a narrative of what you want your new technology to bring to the world. It is unclear how or why that would happen, and this is where you need market-protocol fit.

Using your narrative, it is possible to activate and incentivize a large and diverse range of people to bring about the future you desire. Market-protocol fit is very effective at convincing people that firstly, there IS a problem and secondly to make people do something about this problem. Typically, behaviour change falls into this category. No one thinks that their unsustainable travel is a big problem until it is driven by a strong narrative and impulse for the status quo to be toppled. Market-Protocol fit is good at destabilizing current entrenched social norms or societal patterns- eating unhealthy food. Narratives and incentives can create communities able to spread them around the world and change behaviour on the large scale.

Think about ethereum. Before ethereum, and even now, it is just assumed that closed-ended products like Facebook, would continue to guzzle up consumer data and the corporatization of cyberspace would continue into the forseeable future. Unlike the words in the declaration of independence of cyberspace, we would descend into a oligopoly of powerful internet companies. To bring the internet back to its open protocol days, two things were important. Firstly the technological substrate the ethereum provides, and a strong narrative to the push for decentralization. At the start ethereum didn't solve any specific problem, it was a general substrate that could be molded to fit the narrative it was pushing. It evolves with pace with the narrative.

The parallel search of the design space to push the narrative is more efficient at create new paradigms than simply looking for product market fit.
