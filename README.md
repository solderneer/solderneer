# Hi there, I'm Shan ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring polymath, fiercely passionate about human well-being and flourishing.

I am also an advocate for [Veriditas](https://centuryofbio.substack.com/p/viriditas), and think that solving the hard problems around the human condition will bring paradigm shifts around how we function as a society. 

Have a fascination (some might call it a problem) with brewing speciality coffee â˜•.

Currently interested in longevity science, decentralized systems (especially around web3)  and the philosophy of thought
