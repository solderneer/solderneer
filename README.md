### _👋 Hello there!_
My name is [Shan / Sudharshan / சுதர்சன்](https://solderneer.me/). You might also know me online as **@solderneer** on most platforms. I'm a final year student at [University College London](https://ucl.ac.uk), studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

### _tldr: 🤖 🧠 🦾 ☮️_
I want to contribute to frontier technologies which bring humans and machines into harmony. Currently, human-ai interaction has my fancy, but I'm also curious about other ways to achieve [man-computer symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-Computer_Symbiosis).

Previously, I've worked on projects ranging from [decentralized preventive healthcare](https://hea.care), [modular bioreactors](https://www.dynacyte.com/) and [swarm robotics platforms](https://github.com/makerforceio/Sentibots).
